## 🧬 Core Components

### 1. SwarmNode (`core/swarm_node.py`)
The fundamental unit of the swarm that contains:
- **Neural Network Model**: Transformer-based architecture optimized for distribution
- **P2P Network Layer**: WebSocket + UDP for discovery and communication
- **Consensus Protocol**: Byzantine fault-tolerant coordination
- **Training Coordinator**: Federated learning with gradient sharing
- **Self-Replication**: Ability to clone itself to new systems

**Key Features:**
- Automatic peer discovery and mesh networking
- Real-time model synchronization via consensus
- Byzantine fault tolerance against malicious nodes
- Auto-scaling through self-cloning
- Cryptographic integrity verification

### 2. P2P Network (`network/p2p.py`)
Handles all peer-to-peer communication:
- **UDP Discovery**: Broadcast-based local peer discovery
- **WebSocket Connections**: Reliable message delivery
- **NAT Traversal**: Hole punching for firewall bypass
- **Message Routing**: Efficient swarm-wide communication
- **Connection Management**: Automatic retry and failover

### 3. Transformer Model (`models/transformer.py`)
Neural network optimized for distributed training:
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Standard transformer architecture
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Memory-efficient training
- **Mixed Precision**: FP16 optimization
- **Parameter Sharing**: Efficient weight synchronization
- **Model Estimation**: Memory and compute profiling

### 4. Cooperative Training (`protocols/training.py`)
Implements distributed learning algorithms:
- **Federated Learning**: Gradient sharing and averaging
- **Byzantine Filtering**: Remove malicious/faulty gradients
- **Adaptive Sync**: Dynamic synchronization frequency
- **Reputation System**: Track node reliability
- **Performance Monitoring**: Communication overhead tracking

### 5. Consensus Protocol (`protocols/consensus.py`)
Ensures consistency across the swarm:
- **Leader Election**: Coordinate training rounds
- **Voting Mechanisms**: Resolve model conflicts
- **State Merging**: Combine different model versions
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handle node failures gracefully

### 6. Cryptographic Security (`utils/crypto.py`)
Provides security and integrity:
- **Model Hashing**: Verify model integrity
- **Digital Signatures**: Authenticate messages
- **Secure Serialization**: Encrypted checkpoints
- **Key Management**: Node identification and shared secrets

### 7. Serialization (`utils/serialization.py`)
Efficient data compression and transport:
- **Model Compression**: Gzip + quantization
- **Delta Encoding**: Only send changes
- **Gradient Quantization**: Reduce communication overhead
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent serialization

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic API Usage
```python
import ncrsh_swarm as swarm

# Create and configure a swarm node
node = swarm.SwarmNode(
    swarm.SwarmNodeConfig(
        model_config=swarm.TransformerConfig(
            hidden_size=512, 
            num_layers=6
        ),
        network_config=swarm.NetworkConfig(
            port=8080, 
            max_peers=10
        )
    )
)

# Start the swarm
await node.start()

# Train cooperatively
await node.train(dataset, epochs=100)
```

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Start a node with default settings
ncrsh-swarm start

# Use a configuration preset
ncrsh-swarm start --preset large

# Custom configuration
ncrsh-swarm start --port 9090 --max-peers 20

# Create configuration file
ncrsh-swarm config --preset distributed -o my-config.yaml
```

### Configuration Presets
- **`small`**: 256 hidden, 6 layers (testing/development)
- **`medium`**: 768 hidden, 12 layers (balanced)
- **`large`**: 1024 hidden, 24 layers (production)
- **`distributed`**: Optimized for many nodes
- **`local`**: Single-machine development

## 🔥 Revolutionary Features

### Self-Replication
Nodes can automatically clone themselves to new systems when the swarm grows beyond a threshold, enabling organic scaling without manual intervention.

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
The framework can handle up to 33% malicious or faulty nodes while maintaining correct operation through reputation systems and consensus voting.

### P2P Architecture
No central server required - nodes discover each other automatically and form a resilient mesh network that adapts to topology changes.

### Cooperative Learning
Nodes share gradients and synchronize model states in real-time, enabling faster convergence than traditional distributed training.

### Cryptographic Security
All communications are authenticated and model states are verified for integrity, preventing tampering and ensuring trustworthy operation.
